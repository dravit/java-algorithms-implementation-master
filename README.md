Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in Java


This is a collection of algorithms and data structures which I've implement over the years in my academic and professional life. The code isn't overly-optimized but is written to be correct and readable. The algorithms and data structures are well tested and, unless noted, are believe to be 100% correct.
